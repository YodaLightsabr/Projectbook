# Projectbook: A project manager for MacOS
I set a goal last year to become more organized with my digital files and projects. The farthest I've gotten is making a folder called "Projects" and putting my projects there. I found that it would take a lot of commands to switch from one project to another, and I'd have to spend time searching through them if I forget what I name the folders. That's what Projectbook is for.

## Planned Features
I'm hoping Projectbook will have:
- Simple commands to create, navigate to, and delete projects
- A web interface for people who aren't that familiar with the command line
- Project metadata, including description, website, remote repository URL, and tags
- Automatic configuration for commands to open your favorite IDE, text editor, or other tool when you start a project
- Date information to help remind you of old projects you might've forgotten about

## Current Features
- Nothing
